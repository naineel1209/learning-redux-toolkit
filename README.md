# Day 1 with Redux Toolkit

Hey everyone!

Just wanted to share my excitement about Day 1 of exploring Redux Toolkit. Here's a quick summary of what I learned:

- **Slices:** They help organize state and logic in Redux. Super handy!

- **createSlice:** A time-saving function that generates code for us. Less repetitive coding, yay!

- **Action creators:** Convenient functions that dispatch actions. Makes updating state a breeze.

- **Reducers:** They handle state updates based on dispatched actions. The heart of Redux.

- **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects representing events to modify state.

- **Immer Library:** An amazing
